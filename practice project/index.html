      <h3>Missile Man of India;-</h3>
      <p>
        Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam BR 15 October 1931 â€“ 27 July 2015
        was an Indian aerospace scientist and statesman who served as the 11th
        president of India from 2002 to 2007. He was born and raised in
        Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu and studied physics and aerospace engineering. He
        spent the next four decades as a scientist and science administrator,
        mainly at the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) and
        Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) and was intimately involved in
        India's civilian space programme and military missile development
        efforts.He thus came to be known as the Missile Man of India for his
        work on the development of ballistic missile and launch vehicle
        technology. He also played a pivotal organisational, technical, and
        political role in India's Pokhran-II nuclear tests in 1998, the first
        since the original nuclear test by India in 1974.Kalam was elected as
        the 11th president of India in 2002 with the support of both the ruling
        Bharatiya Janata Party and the then-opposition Indian National Congress.
        Widely referred to as the "People's President", he returned to his
        civilian life of education, writing and public service after a single
        term. He was a recipient of several prestigious awards, including the
        Bharat Ratna, India's highest civilian honour. While delivering a
        lecture at the Indian Institute of Management Shillong, Kalam collapsed
        and died from an apparent cardiac arrest on 27 July 2015, aged 83.
        Thousands, including national-level dignitaries, attended the funeral
        ceremony held in his hometown of Rameswaram, where he was buried with
        full state honours.
